### What is SpecieFi?

Imagine you are an illiterate farmer owning 10 acres of forest land in a rural region of India, who has no idea about smartphones or modern technologies. How does one create a multi-layer neural network classifying forest species with the help of data supplied by these farmers?

Welcome, SpecieFi - a first-of-its-kind offline-first application that enables the community-based classification of images through a simple game. It is an accessibility-focused application for users with limited reading and writing capacity. It can be used across multiple users for the classification of images, specially designed for the classification of forest species.
